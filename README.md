# MFP_Group_Member_Lookup
A short shell script to help find and manage individual members for large
groups on MFP

It is nearly impossible to do simple per-user administration through the MFP
website. You need to find each person on the member list. For groups with
thousands of members, and hundreds of pages on their member lists, even
locating a member is difficult.  This is a quick hack to point you in the right
direction.
